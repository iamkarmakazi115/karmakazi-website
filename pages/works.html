Instead, it becomes the night his parents die and a supernatural assassin called the Hunter comes to claim what flows in his veins.</p>
                            
                            <p>Kael is the last descendant of the Progenitor, the first werewolf, and his blood is the key to an ancient relic that could either save the world or destroy it. Thrust into a war between supernatural races, he must forge unlikely alliances with exiled Fae warriors, battle-scarred trolls, storm-wielding djinn, and vengeful banshees—all while learning to master the beast within.</p>
                            
                            <p>As genetically twisted monstrosities ravage cities and the mad tyrant Valek Dorne builds an army of horrors, Kael faces an impossible choice: embrace the very power that makes him a target, or watch everything he loves burn.</p>
                            
                            <p>From underground troll monasteries to floating djinn cities, from spectral banshee realms to his sister's final sacrifice, Kael must become what the world fears most—and what it desperately needs.</p>

                            <p>Blood Howls is a dark urban fantasy that blends supernatural politics, visceral action, and the timeless struggle between vengeance and justice. In a world where ancient bloodlines determine fate, one man must choose between the monster he could become and the hero he was meant to be.</p>

                            <p>Then Elena is kidnapped.</p>
                            
                            <p>The ransom isn't money—it's blood. Five divine bloodlines must die to fuel an ancient ritual that will birth a god without conscience, without love, without the weaknesses that make divinity worth worshipping. Each kill brings Christos closer to saving the woman he loves, but further from the man he wants to be.</p>
                            
                            <p>As Chicago burns with divine fire and Titans descend from storm-torn skies, Christos discovers his father's true plan: not just to create the perfect god, but to tear down the masquerade that has kept supernatural and human worlds separate for centuries. The age of hiding is ending. The age of gods is beginning again.</p>
                            
                            <p>But gods, Christos learns, are made by the choices they make—not the power they inherit.</p>
                            
                            <p>Forgotten Son is an urban fantasy that explores what happens when ancient powers clash with modern love, when family loyalty wars with moral conviction, and when the greatest divine act might be choosing to serve rather than rule. In a world where gods walk among mortals and the dead demand justice, one man must decide what kind of god he's willing to become.</p>

                            <p>Cael Ward Corbin has spent years hiding what he is: a memory-binder caught between the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, hunting rogues in the shadows of the Interworld Accord. When Prince Alarion is found crucified in a human town square, carved with the forbidden sigil of the long-dead Outriders, Cael's investigation unearths a conspiracy that reaches into the heart of his own buried past.</p>
                            
                            <p>Partnered with Vaelira Elaren, a Court agent whose loyalties run deeper than her blade, Cael follows a trail of royal blood and stolen names across the Feywild's most dangerous territories. Each murder reveals another piece of an ancient ritual designed to birth a god without conscience—and each clue points toward a truth the Courts erased from history.</p>
                            
                            <p>But the killer isn't just rewriting the future. They're unmaking the past, using forbidden shadowglass magic to steal identities and forge Mirrorborn assassins. And when Cael discovers his own name carved in blood at a crime scene, he realizes he's not hunting the conspiracy—he's part of it.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a world where names have power and memory can be rewritten, Cael must confront the identity he lost, the woman he loves, and the father who tried to unmake him. Because the Mirrorwild is rising, the Treaty between realms is cracking, and only a name that was forbidden to exist can prevent a war that would shatter three worlds.</p>
                            
                            <p>Out of Time is an urban fantasy that weaves Fae politics with identity horror, where the greatest magic is choosing who you are when the world insists you're someone else.</p>

Raised in secret by a shapeshifting Glamourling, Veraden has spent decades infiltrating his mother's forces, but his rescue mission sets in motion a chain of betrayals, bloodshed, and broken oaths that will consume both realms.</p>
